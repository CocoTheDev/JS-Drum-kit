#  Vanilla JavaScript Project  (10h)  
####  GitHub  Page : [https://cocothepimp.github.io/JS-Drum-kit/](https://cocothepimp.github.io/JS-Drum-kit/)  
  
##  Goals and  origins  of the  project :  
This  project  comes from  [https://javascript30.com/](https://javascript30.com/).  
JavaScript30  is  a free 30  days  challenge, 1  project  per  day, only vanilla Js.  
  
My purpose of doing this challenge, is to understand the fundamentals of JavaScript before working with frameworks. I  came  from Ruby and  Php, so  front  is 'new' for me, although  I  did  little  project  in Js.  
  
##  Always push  creativity :  
I  don't like  following  tutorial, and  stop  the project right after. I'm always trying to add something that I judge important. In this  case,  I  add  the  **recording  function**, and the  **play  function**.  
  
  
##  Things  that  challenges  me :  
1) Restart project from  scratch  (js part only)  the next day after  watching  the  tutorial  
2) I didn't know how to  pass  the event  from  EventListener  to a non-anonymous  function  (Js30  tuto  used  anonymous)  
3) Function runs and  ended  whereas  the loop  is  executing  (lost A LOT of  time, before  knowing  it  was  that)  
4) Trying  to  break  if  statement  inlines  with  return, but causing  issue  
  
##  What I  learned  *-little  things matter  too* :  
1) It's  good  to restart little project from  scratch,  makes  code  cleaner  
2) Understand how to  pass  the event variable from the  EventListener  to a non-anonymous  function  
3) What's  a  keyCode  
4) How to access to div attributes  
5) Change and  remove  class  &  style  in a div  
6) Using  QuerySelector  
7) For and  ForEach loops  aren't 'breakable'...  
8) Using  setTimeout  avoid  function to  finish  while there's  a for  loop  working  
9) audio.methods()  
10) Using splice to  empty  an  array  
11) Pushing  value in  a  array  (yes, my knowledge in Js is small haha)  
12) Using  EventListener  on 'keydown'  (always used on 'click' since now)  
13) Make  better  Readme !
